# Alles Speaker RevB getting started notes

Hello! You're the lucky owner of at least one Alles speaker. This guide will help you get started.

## The Speaker

Each Alles speaker has four buttons up top and a USB micro receptacle on back. 

Before getting going, let's make sure the speaker is charged or charging. Simply plug a USB cable between the speaker and any USB charge point, like a phone charger or a port on a computer. (The speaker will show up as a USB device for debugging and upgrades, but you don't have to worry about that for now -- all control happens wirelessly.) The battery will last "a few hours" making constant music and longer with sparse or silence. It shouldn't take more than an hour or so to charge. If the power button does not make any noise, it's probably a dead battery.

If this is your first time using the speaker, you'll need to tell it which WiFi network to join. You can easily change this later, but once you set it, you don't need to set it again. 

The row of buttons up top, facing the speaker, are power, MIDI (+), WiFi (-) and restart (Play/Pause).

The power button turns the speaker off and on. When you turn it on, it will re-join the network and mesh. 

The MIDI button (+) will put the speaker into MIDI mode. In this mode, Bluetooth MIDI is activated and the speaker will stay silent and act as a MIDI relay to the rest of the mesh. So you will need at least two Alleses to use MIDI mode and hear audio. Press MIDI again to restart into normal mode.

The WiFi button (-) will forget the WiFi details, if any were stored, and put the device into WiFi setup mode. This is the default if no WiFi has yet been set. 

The restart (Play/Pause) button simply restarts the speaker. 


## Join a WiFi network

Press the power button. You'll start to hear a "chime noise" repeating. This is the "searching for WiFi" sound, and will play until it finds a WiFi point. If you've already set a WiFi network, after about a few seconds the chime noise will end and you'll hear a "bleep" tone and then silence. That means the WiFi network has been joined and everything is ready to go.

If you haven't set WiFi yet, now open your nearest mobile phone or any WiFi device with a browser. Go to join a new WiFi network on your device and you'll see a network listed called `alles-synth-XXXXXX` where `XXXXXX` is a unique string per speaker (useful when you have many speakers!). Join that network. On most devices (iPhones, Androids especially) after a few seconds, a browser window will appear with a login page. This is like when you join a hotel's network or other captive portal. Wait a few seconds for the login page to populate with all the nearby WiFi stations it finds. After you see the one you want the speaker to join, tap it and carefully enter its password. After a few moments, the speaker should stop chiming, indicating it has succesfully joined the network and saved the details to its internal storage. 

If this doesn't seem to work, try again by hitting the WiFi button (-) and the process will repeat again.
